    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      With a background in Computer Science and practical experience in mobile app development, I enjoy creating digital solutions that are both functional and user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past year, I've worked with Eclectics International as an E-Cohort Member and later as a Junior Software Engineer, contributing to impactful projects like the <strong>Consolidated Bank Android App (Kotlin)</strong>, <strong>Internet Banking App (React Native)</strong>, and <strong>Ushuru Sacco Android Application (Java)</strong>. These experiences have sharpened my skills in cross-functional collaboration, problem-solving, and agile development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in continuous learning, teamwork, and technology that makes a difference. Whether I'm debugging code or mentoring others, I strive to make a positive impact â€” one line at a time.
